The figma file is availabe [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design).

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT).
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
